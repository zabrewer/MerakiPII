# simple example script that uses MerakiPII.PIICalls module to get all PII Requests for a given Network
# A 404/null means the API call was successful but no PII call has been made for the network/org  
# PII delete and/or restrict processing examples start with example19-SubmitNewOrgDelRequest-MAC.py
# run those examples against a given network/org if you need data to return for this and other examples

# API Documentation for this call:  https://dashboard.meraki.com/api_docs#list-the-pii-requests-for-this-network-or-organization

# If you don't have a test environment, you can use DevNet Meraki Cloud Sandbox with a free account:

# see getNetworkPIIRequests function in PIICalls module for details and arguments
# and see the 1st example (example1getOrgPIIRequests.py) for various ways to assign values for API calls
# for this file and other examples, we are using config.ini file for values

# next line imports PIICalls.py from the MerakiPII directory
